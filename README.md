### Notes ###
The local JSON file must have the filename ```favs.json```.

You can navigate through the pages by using the buttons at the top of the page or you can "swipe left" to go to the next page and "swipe right" to go to the previous page. 

When runnning on Chrome desktop browser, run ```chrome.exe --allow-file-access-from-files```.

The git logs are not an accurate representation of our group's work distribution.  Peter and Fahd worked on their parts through pair programming.
