===========
Hey guys, I started on the assignment.
I got some of the code from one of our tutorials in class (http://csc309.fabspaces.cc/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/JqueryMobile.zip).
It works on Firefox but for some reason it doesn't work on Chrome (the tutorial code also doesn't work on Chrome).


For Chrome you need to run chrome.exe --allow-file-access-from-files in order to access local JSON files.
